<h1>Great for the price</h1>
<h2>5 stars</h2>
<p>Love this tablet. Power lasts long. Short charge time. HD screen is really clear. Only con is that there are some apps not available like Google play. Very satified. Have a 128gb card in mine . Plenty of space for downloads. The camera has no flash and is not the best but I didnt buy this tablet for that. High recommend the HD tablet 8gb amazon fire. You want go wrong.</p>
