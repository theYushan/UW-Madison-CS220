<h1>Excellent tablet for the price.</h1>
<h2>4 stars</h2>
<p>I have a nexus 9 but it is painstakingly slow so I wanted something that does not lag Everytime I try to use the browser and does not freeze whilst playing games and this gets the job done very well. The battery life is also very good. Highly recommended for casual browsing and games.</p>
