<h1>The Light Makes All the Difference</h1>
<h2>5 stars</h2>
<p>I have been a Kindle reader for years now but this is the first device I have used with a backlight and I have to say the eye strain is lower and the reading experience better than ever. For a pure reading device I do not know how it could be better other than lowering the price tag.</p>
