<h1>Great e reader but a bit over priced</h1>
<h2>3 stars</h2>
<p>It is the top of the line e reader by amazon which is also the leader in e readers. The voyage is an excellent device and very versatile to carry on your trips. I feel the premium for the page turn sensors is little too high. In hindsight I would go with the paper white and save a few bucks.</p>
