<h1>Fantastic tablet for kids</h1>
<h2>5 stars</h2>
<p>This has been a wonderful tablet for our 9 year old son. I was able to set reading achievements that he must complete before he can play his games or watch videos. I like how you can secure it and adjust the setting to what we find appropriate for our child.</p>
