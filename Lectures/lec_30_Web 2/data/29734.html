<h1>Amazon Tap</h1>
<h2>5 stars</h2>
<p>Amazon Tap is exactly what I expected it would be. The sound quality is good with the Alexa features. I love that you can charge it on the base or with micro USB cord. I would recommend it to anyone that is interested in Amazon Echo and would like the portability.</p>
